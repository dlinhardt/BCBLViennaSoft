% A simple EyeLink gaze-contingent demo showing how to retrieve online events from a buffer.
% In each trial an image is presented with a red gaze-contingent dot overlaid on top.
% The dot's location is based on the average x y coordinates of fixations updated online every 50ms via a FIXUPDATE event.
% See EyeLink Programmers Guide manual > Experiment Templates Overview > Control > Fixation Update Events
